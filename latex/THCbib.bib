Robbe, David, et al. "Cannabinoids reveal importance of spike timing coordination in hippocampal function." Nature neuroscience 9.12 (2006): 1526-1533.	
	Method: 1. used MEA to record LFP & single cells in CA1 pyr. layer in rats doing t-maze alternation task
			2. studied in control, CP55 (strong CB1 agonist) & THC (weak THC agonist) - systemic injections
			3. analyzed using: 	LFP-FFT, LFP-spectogram, task performance (TP), TP vs. theta power, ripple-power-ratio histograms, MFR vs theta, autocorr of pyr & IN, ISI fraction <10s, rasterplot pop. synchorny, cross-corr & peak,
			4. used 'ANCOVA' to show that theta reduced even whe running speed accounted for
	Result: 1. Intro summary: "Here, we show that cannabinoids disrupt the temporal coordination of hippocampal neurons and deteriorate theta, gamma and ripple network patterns without substantial changes in principle cell and interneuron average firing rates.
								Furthermore, we found that the reduction of hippocampal theta oscillations by cannabinoids correlates with memory impairment in a hippocampus-dependent task."			
			2. they did actually find a slight decrease (7.4%) in pyr. MFR at highest doses of .3mg CP55, but not in IN
	Discussion: 1. b4 this it was only known that THC reduces gamma power in LFP - not theta & not single cells...
				2. "Although modification of oscillatory patterns is often observed after surgical and pharmacological interference in the medial septum and systemic treatment with anesthetics or GABAB agonists,
						alteration of LFP power independent of firing rates changes appears to be a unique effect of CB1 agonists.
						This may be brought about by a balanced decrease in glutamate release from excitatory afferents, reduction in GABAergic inhibition by CCK interneurons and the indirect reduced excitatory drive of other interneurons"
				3. Final summary: "Overall, our findings indicate that under the influence of cannabinoids, neurons are liberated from population control.
									Although individual neurons continue to discharge at the same rate, they fail to organize into temporally coordinated assemblies.
									A clear disadvantage of decreased synchrony is the reduced effectiveness of the population output on their downstream targets, even though the same numbers of spikes are emitted.
									We hypothesize that such hippocampus-wide impairment of network coordination, reflected by the reduction of LFP power, is causally related to the cannabinoid-induced memory impairment."
				4. connection to epilepsy: "The synchrony-reducing effects of CB1 receptor activation may also underlie the antiepileptic effects of endocannabinoids" 					
	Questions: 	1. both THC & CP55 used, but their strength was never compared....
	For Us:
		1. Fig2d: compared change in performance vs theta power reduction....
		2. busting analysis (or ISI fraction <10ms) see fig6
		3. metrics of population synchrony under THC? using fano factor, see fig7
		4. given theory of decreased glutamate & GABA release, check excitatory index!

Robbe, David, and György Buzsáki. "Alteration of theta timescale dynamics of hippocampal place cells by a cannabinoid is associated with memory impairment." The Journal of neuroscience 29.40 (2009): 12597-12605.
	Method: 1. recorded place cell activity in CA1 using tetrode array (array of tetrodes or electrodes?) before during and after THC injection
			2. had animal doing t-maze alternation task while place cells being recorded
	Results:1. observed that THC significnatly lowered performance & slowed down animal
			2. observed that place cell maps were largely unaltered w/ THC. However the size of their place feilds very slightly decreased!
			3. observed that THC DID inhibit theta dynamics via:
				a. lowered theta peak freq from 8-10 to 7-9***. said it was independant of speed
				b. lowered theta POWER, however said this was related to speed!
				c. had proof that SYSTEM (vs signal) theta interactions between cells decreased. this is similar to PDMs
			4. saw declined MFR w/ THC. Says the cannabioid affect on MFR due to lwoer speed. We say its more than that (maybe)
	Discussion: 1. says that in THC ,more pyramid cells were recruited, suggesting less became silent**
				2. punch line of article is that we cant know if spatial coding is based on 'cognitive map theory' (ie place fields) or theta dynamics. THC allows us to disrupt theta dynamics & leave intact PFs. We see that behavior disrupted even w/ intact place fields, which argues against cognitive map theory.........},

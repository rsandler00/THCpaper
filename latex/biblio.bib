				2. Made EC lesion to see if DG still activated afterwards
		Results:1. Saw that ipsi&contra CA3 stim will (1) activate EC (2) cause EC to reactivate DG! (reentrance)
				2. Saw that lesioning EC will abolish 'late' (reentrant) DG potl from CA3com stim  (see fig.7)
				3. Saw that CA3c will also activate DG (Scharfman)
				4. Saw that THETA commisural stim is ideal to potentiate EC & DG. **Note, CA3 not potentiated by this theta?? (pg 49)
		Discussion: 1. Avoids antidromic stim of MF (when studying CA3-->DG) by lowering current, since antidrom has higher threshold than orthodrom
				2. Suggests CA3-->EC pathway is from direct connection, not via subiculum. Claims it probly isnt CA1 since stim @ CA1 doesnt give nearly as good EC readout!
				3. Gives very good timing of delays in last paragraph (pg54): Commis.CA3 stim -> 0-3ms contra DG,CA3  -> +1-3ms CA1 -> +7-10ms EC +3 DG: 18-25ms tot loop time!

		Results:1. suggests seizures start in CA# and finish in EC (see Buszaki,1997 for counter). Only spanned ~2s, used visual evidence
				2. divides seizure into stage1 (2-3Hz), stage2 (15-25Hz). In S1, EDs start in CA3-->CA1->EC and stop. In S2, they go through whole loop (inc. DG) and back. S2 marked by first ED in DG!
				3. Shows show seizures synchronize along septotemporal axis
				4. Records cells intracellularly and relates to extracellular potl:
					a. cell APs correspond to EDs
					b. CA3 cells exhibit bursting 100-150Hz
					c. CA3 & CA1 cells have PDS (ie elevated baseline after MDA)
		Discussion: 1. The first (as far as I know, see Buszaki 89,91) paper to suggest loop activity in seizures. Proof is:
						a. circumstntial evidence: CA1 EDs proceded by DG volume conductance
						b. sequintial unidirectional nature of EDs (see fig. 5ab,6)
				2. Mentions connections w/ Strangers MDA (pg 1879). Says MDA==stage2 ED
				3. talks about CA3-1 gap junctions as source of synchronization. pg 1879

  notes={As far as which frequencies are involved in hippocampal seizures, it depends whether you are looking at ECoG or EEG
            and whether the seizure began in the hippocampus or began in the neocortex and then spread to the hippocampus. For
            seizures which begin in the hippocampus, ECoG shows initial oscillations of 12-20Hz which progress to 5-9 Hz (theta).
            EEG can only pick up the 2nd stage of theta rhythms (this subtlety made this really confusing to research). Neocortical
            seizures usually have rhythms of 2-5 Hz. Once these seizures spread to the hippocampus, the 2-5 Hz rhythms can continue
            or they can turn into 5-9 Hz theta rhythms.	}

  notes={REVIEW of epilepsy DBS techniques & mechanisms. More technical, less clinical
		I. Intro - goal of epilepsy DBS is to create inhibition / desynchronization using currents. 		Also notes, DBS is the only soln. in 'elequent areas' (those which cant be resected)
		II. Uniform DC fields - uses 2 electrodes to create field between them. Effectiveness depends on relative orientation to cells (must be from basal to apical dendrites). Affective in high-K,low-Ca models. Works by hyperpolarizing cells.
		III. Localized DC fields - uses 1 electrode. Effective in penicillin,high-K,low-C,kindling models. Hyper/depol depends on whether electrode is by soma or dendrites.
			-works by DEPOLARIZIKNG the cell and causing 'depolarization block', which prevents APs when cell is too depold (~ -40mV).
		IV. LFS & Single Pulse stim- not orientation dept & only need to be applied during event, not chronically... Several methods exist
			A. Phase resetting & singularity- use single pulse right @ critical phase bifurcation ... ? (fig6). So far only used in slices. Assumes system has stable oscill & stable fixed point (nooscill) states. Says below technqiues have much animal studies but few clinical ones
			B. phase reseting & desynchronization- fig7 - assumes system has dysyncd stabvle modes
			C. chaos control - wtf???
			D. LFS- gives some sources for 1-1.3hz , & TMS studies - suggests works by inducing LTD, but not sure
		V. HFS- says HFS have much clinical studies, but few experimental ones... Suggests it works by extracellular K+ rise which induces depoarization block. Other theories are NT buildup, loss of info transfer, specific activation of inhib pathways...

				-CLmodel done between Subthalamic nuclei (STN) and GPe (globus palladus)
				-CLmodel fit by averaging PSTH of all neurons in model & then fitting w/ a decaying sinewave (see fig 3)
			2. took z-transform of this model & analyzed it for healthy/Parkinson's differences - saw PD had poles closer to axis (less stable) see fig5
			3. Used Phase-Resetting Curve (PRC) & Lyoynov eponent (LE) to calculate effect of stimulus in disrupting population synchrony
	Results:1. validated parammetric model -->nonparam model conversion by making prediction froms nonparam tp param. see fig7
			2. used LE as a measure of pop synchrony & then chose DBS freq which maximized LE - found 85Hz. Then he tested this on full param model, and saw that best freq  was 75Hz, thus validating the whole framework! (see fig9)
	Discussion: 1. in PD there are increased beta (13-35hz) oscillations in basal ganglia & currently ~115Hz stim used to suprress them
				2. WOW, he said parkinsons patients can spend 18-41 hours in clininc during 1st year to optimize paramters!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!}

  notes={I. Contributors to Extracellular Fields
			1. synaptic activity: Na+ going from extraell to intracell makes SINK. To maintain ELECTRONEUTRALITY, a passive SOURCE develops. This makes inverted extracell voltage (think Loeb final)
				-GABA makes little contrib. since its resting potl is so close to baseline
			2. Action Potls- can only contribute a. to >100Hz activity (see fig.5) and ONLY if synchrony maintained. However AHP may make more lasting contrib. Thus >100Hz activity can be used as proxy for single spikes
				-suggests AHP behind delta waves
			3. calcium spikes, gap junctions
			4. instrinsic currents and resonances (I-h) - must be occuring synchronously, which is most common in interneurons
			5. Ephatic effects- macro LFP feedback to cells. in normal comp. not much effects, but in hypersynchronous states, it can deliver as much current as TransCranialStim which is known to have effects!
		II. Determinants of LFP strength: architecture & synchrony
			1. Neuronal geometry and architecture- pyr. cells are arranged in parr. & thus their dipoles can add up.	
				-apparently, human hippo. has cell bodies vertically shifted to each other & thus human hippo. ECoG much weaker than rodent!
			2. Temporal Synchrony-
				-good example of cerebellum, which has perfect geometry for LFPs, but since all computations are LOCAL, there is no synchrony and thus no LFP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
				-1/f^n power law: power is inversely prop. to freq by 1/f^n law! This due to low-pass spatial filtering, slower freqs can recruit more neurons
		IV. Inverse problem - reconstructing micro events & dipole sources from macro LFP
			1. due to VOLUME CONDUCTION, LFP ALWAYS requires verification of its local nature
			2. CSD analysis can determine if source is close or far, kinda}

  notes={I. INTRO: Q1. What causes brain rhythms
			A1a- connectivity between fundamentally nonoscillatory neurons - however this has never been found experimentally
			A1b- inherebt neuronal resonance - vast evidence for. Note, A1a&A1b can reinforce each other!
		II. Resonance as a probe of frequency preferance
			1. gives sources (upto 2000) of studies using ZAP funcrtions on neurons (sources 5-14 on cardiac cells, inner ear, squid axon, neocortex) & some conductances used to generate them (Ca2+,K+,Na+,etc...)
			2. BOX1: resonance is func. of impedance, z=1/wC=H(w)=Y(w)/X(w). Can be modeled w/ RLC circuit
		III. How to Make resonances: Rule of thumb
			1. As in circuit to have resonance/pass-band you need low-pass component (here, membrane capacitance) and high-pass component (here,?)
			2. High-pass component is 'current that oppose membrane voltage'- aka rectifying currents which have rev.potl. @ bottom of their protein gate activation curve (see Fig.2,3). They are negative-feedback. Their pulse (not impulse) response is thus high pass! Ex. are K+
		IV. Amplifying currents, amplified resonance, and oscillations
			1. To amplify resonance, you need positive feedback mechanism where reversal potl is at the top of its activation curve (like weak AP). Examples are I-Na, I-NDMA, I-CA2+
			2. BOX2: Uses simple neuron model & phase plane to show how diff. conductance (g-K,g-Na) parameters lead to either damped,damped-oscillatory,spontaneous oscillatory
		For us:
			1. afterpotl cant be biological source of resonance since res. arises even subthreshold!
			2. pg.218 - says in neocortex cells have 2 resonances (1-2Hz & 5-20Hz) which activate at diff. depol levels!}

  notes={Numba1: Brain systems involved in generation of theta rhythms
		1. Hippocampal TH not. necc connected to TH in other parts of brain
		2. distinction between 'current generator' (transmembrane currents resp. for magn. of LFP) & 'rhythm generator' - mechanisms resp. for emergence and contro, of oscillatory patterns
		3. theta observed most strongly in CA1 (in terms of LFP)
		4. rhythm generators can act either by 'permissive action' (allows emergence) or 'pacemaker action' (outputs theta)
	II. Hippocampal - Septum (or Septal Nuclei) connection
		1. The minimum required condition for theta in HP is intact connection to MS-DBB (medial septum-diagonal band of Broca)
		2. septum only projects to inhibitory interneurons in HP
		3. HP interneurons are only HP cells which project to septum
	III. Classic Theta Model (fig.2)
		1. Based on CSD (current source density) analysis of CA1. Shows excit in Lac-mol (from EC) and inhib. in str.oriens/pyr (from interneurons/septum) (fig.4)
		2. Assumed EC \& septum are both pacemakers which can subthreshold potls across pyr. cells which (since pyr cells aligned) cause large extracell. potls!
		3. This model has several weaknesses. see pg. 327
	IV. 2 Types of Theta:
		1. In aenesthized animals atropine (ACh blocker) comp. removes theta. In awake, it doesnt, suggesting 2 independant theta mechanisms:
			A. Atropine-Sensitive TH: facilitated by ACh; blocked by Atropine
			B. Atropine-Resistant TH: fac. by NMDA**, blocked by urethane, ketamine, EC lesion! Believed to be conveyed by EC-->CA
	V. Relationship of single cells to LFP
		1. strong vs weak/threshold responders depol @ TH peak
		2. strong resp. depol b4 peak and cause most of responce. Thus not all pyr. cells tuned to TH the same. This is spike-phase-procession / rate-coding
	VI. Relationship of TH to LTP  Learning!
		-need to read closer
	VII. Theta in CA3 (pg330-331)
		1. small TH sink in CA1 from CA3. Small since only small # of CA3 neurons active at any given time. There is about a 145deg TH phase shift between them (Buzsaki,2009)
		2. CA3 doesnt have much TH LFP for logistical reasons (small dendritic arbor, etc...) Thus, it was largely ignored!
		3. CA3 is able to generate inherent TH
			-if EC removed only TH in CA1 is in str. rad from CA3.
			-Probalby makes TH genreator from recurr. connections between itself \& maybe DG
			-is Cholinergic TH (atropine-sensitive), since w/o/ ACh it is abolished! Also, CA3 TH can be elicited in slices w/ ACh agonist!}

				2. Saw it was independant of CA3 (although CA3 also seemingly could?)
				3. Saw it was AMPA/GABA/NMDA activated, but w.o. ACh (thus atropine resistant)
				4. Saw that splitting CA1, seperate th. oscillators emerge in both regions, w/ slightly diff freq, suggesting entrainment
				5. See FIG3c. Shows that theta peak synced w/ pyr. firing. INs syncd to offpeak & induce pyr firing. Thus a loop between CA1 Pyr & IN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
		Discussion: 1. Talks about relation of intrinsic TH w/ MS-induced TH
						a. Says int. TH 10-20% of in-vivo values, thus strongly attenuated
						b. This study doesnt contradict MS lesion studies which abolish TH, since they measure TH power, not periodicity!!! (thus this power much less, but still periodic). Also, all those studies report slight residual TH ascribed to bad lesion

		2. Distinction 2: TH#1, atropine-resistant TH prev during exploration, while TH#2, atropine-sensitive prev. during immobility and SWS  + urethane anesthesia
		3. reasons why TH important	a. LTP sensitive to TH phase b. human recordings c. place cells d. -- e. septal lesions decrease memory performance
		4. Both chol & GABA Ns important to hippo TH. Lesioning either will effect it
		5. See fig. 3 for SCHEMATIC~!!!!!!!
	VII. Epilepsy &  (AD)
		1. AD lnked to loss of ACh neurons (all FDA drugs increase this). Epilepsy kills these neurons due to neurodegeneration through ischemia/hypoxia. Thus E-->ND-->ACh loss -->AD
		2. Suggests loss of septal ACh input leads to lack of ACh in hippo & lack of atr-sensitive theta & thus AD
			-proof1: injection of B-plaque in septum kills ACh cells & lowers task performance
			-proof2: in AD humans, ChAT (ACh making enzyme) reduced by 60 in MS-DBB!!!! } }

  notes={I. Intro: synchronization by itself reduces amount of info in neuron ensambles, so whats the benefit? 2 things: strengthens syncd input onto target output cell 2) syncd inputs raise LTP in target output cell.
		II. Gamma Frequency Hypothesis
				a. gamma suggested to be critical because it has resonance with LTP, which is hypothesized to occur at 10-30ms (33-100Hz)
			2.1 a. "gamma-interneuron hypothesis"- gamma caused by pyr-IN interactions & INs inhibit pyr cells and thus carve out precise time windows during which pyrs may fire
				b. "gamma phase procession"- more depolarized pyr cells fire earlier in gamma cycle. Thus pyr cells encode the strength of their synaptic inputs in their gamma phase!	NOTE: this is still a hypothesis
			2.2 a. only subset of  cells syncd to th & gma. thus it has proved difficult to detect th & gama changes w/ behavioral task
			2.3 Theory of DG/EC-->CA3 Gamma encoding:
				1. increased gamma coherence in responce to stimulus (how this happens is open question)
				2. Makes input (DG/EC) spikes fire at same gamma phase as output (CA3) spikes, which induces LTP
				3. memorys encoded as I/O synapse strengts in LTP
					-NOTES: involves CA# recurrent conn. works w/ weak inputs; 'hebbian' (I  & O dept) plasticity
		III. Theta-Gamma Hypothesis
			3.2 THETA RESET- there is a reset to a fixed theta phase across hippo-EC after stimulus presentation, which leads to TH sync & learning in following steps
				1. inputs arrive to output at random TH phases & thus cant elicit APs/LTP
				2. stimulus occurs & TH reset happens, now all inputs arrive in same peak TH phase to output, which leads to LTP
					-proof: it has been shown that inputs arriving at TH peak lead to LTP, while those at TH trough lead to LTD
				3. after learning, the same inputs can elicit spikes in earlier in TH cycle to to the LTP	
					-this can result in place cell TH phase procession
					-NOTES: thus TH dept synaptic plasticity is LTP between input & TH phase, not input & output as w/ gamma
			3.3 Theta thus responds to stimulus, while gamma does not. Their comodulation/interaction can thus lead to answering our Q in 2.3.1 (ie how gamma coh results from stimuli pres)
		IV. Sharp Waves & HFOs
				-sharp waves: "During immobility and consummatory behavior as well as during slow-wave sleep, the recurrent collaterals of the CA3 region of the hippocampus are released from subcortical inhibition so that activation of a small subset of CA3 cells gives rise to synchronous population discharges"
				-physiological sharp waves are 100-200Hz, epileptic HFOs are 200-500Hz
				these are replayed at sleep to consolidate memory....}

		A. Conn. of allocentric navigation & semantic memory
			1. GRID CELLS- EC layer2 (& subiculum) cells which have periodic lattice-triangle firing feilds (fig2a)
			2. unline place cells, grid cells active in ALL most environments, and their remapping only involves phase/offset changes. Thus they form a universal map
				-suggests that EC grid cells form ensemble input to downstream target of place cells. Thus, they allow each place cell to fire only at very specifc combos (ie places). SEE FIG. 3!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
			3. suggests grid/place cell / hippo/EC network cant just we for nav. since (1) insects can do nav. w/ much less cells (2) only a dozen grid cells needed to define environment...
				a. thus this system can be used not only for relationships to map but also events/objects in SEMANTIC MEMORY
				b. further proof is (1) assymetry of free recall mirrors assymetry of place cells (ie reverse nav. doesnt have same fields). (2) temporal contiguity of recollection (ie if i jump your memory to event you can proceed from there much easier
		B. path integration & episodic memory
			1. episodic memory is path integration through experiance/time

				2. dynamic threshold increased SPUR by 33% (on average)!!! Also greatly increased ROC area!
				3. Saw threshold increases w/ recent AP.
		Discussion: 1. He has 2 feedback kernels: h, for afterpotential, and k for threshold dynamics. h is for potential output and k is for ST output. In ST-->ST models, h & k comined into 1 feedback kernel. That having been said, this shows that in ST-->ST models, h has 1)2nd order dynamics  2)fast (afterpotential) and slow (threshold) dynamics, thus 2 alphas!

  notes={Method: 1. recorded MABP, CBFV (cer. blood vel), EDCO2 in 15 control subjects & got 2 global PDM systems
				2. constructed 3 VARIABLE CL model!!!! EDCO2 was the '3rd variable' which was NOT predicted by model but a sort of 'predefined' 2nd input disturbance (see Fig2)
				3. has some basic math showing nature of CL. see eq. 1-4
				4. has good math of SiCL vs OL
				5. good math on comparing w/ kinear system in laplace domain
		Results:1. in fig10 compared OL & SiCL reposnce to a pulse . showed that cL results are different!
				2. compared reosnances only in CL mode. (fig11)
				3. compared w/ 2 linear models (linear-PDM & traditional-linear) fig12
		Discussion: 1. pg. 1034: suggests that you can 'measure' nonlin of system by checking coherence across frequencies (table1). Also checked residuals of each input in freq domain (fig8)
				2. assessed influence of each input by explaatory power (%NMSE) they covered in output!
				3. pg. 1030, talks about if CL true, whjat it would mean for OL results:
					"These previous studies have yielded useful results, but they do not take into account the “closed-loop” nature of the subject system—i.e., the fact that changes in blood flow may also affect the blood pressure of cerebral perfusion, and not only the other way around—which is expressed herein as our “working hypothesis.” If this working hypothesis becomes validated, the “open-loop” studies and the previously obtained results are not invalidated. However, they must be interpreted in the open-loop context, which is distinct from the “closed-loop” context discussed in this paper. We maintain that there is considerable scientific value (and potential clinical utility) in studying and understanding the closed-loop characteristics of the CFA-CVMR system, as elaborated below. This paper presents a general methodology with which physiological closed-loop systems can be studied in general and, in particular, it demonstrates its application to the closed-loop analysis (CLA) of the CFA-CVMR system of cerebral hemodynamics."
				4. very open about lack of evidence either theoretical or validation:
					"  The relative evaluation of the closed-loop results of these methods is not possible in the absence of a meaningful criterion, since the prediction errors based on the experimental data are the same in closed-loop and open-loop analysis. Possible differences between open-loop and CLA can be evaluated through correlation with clinical data in the case of a specific disease (not relevant to this study) or through model predictions of data collected in specialized experiments where specific external disturbances are imposed as stimuli (not available in this study)."
					"  It is posited herein as a working hypothesis that the system of cerebral hemodynamics operates in “closed-loop” (i.e., changes in cerebral perfusion pressure affect cerebral blood flow and vice versa, and CO2 tension affects both blood flow and blood pressure). Since direct physiological evidence of such a closed-loop operation in cerebral hemodynamics is heretofore limited (e.g., the modulation of blood pressure by flow-mediated changes in cerebrovascular impedance and/or a possible “central baroreflex” in response to oscillations in blood flow), the presented CLA is intended to generate, rather than to test, our key working hypothesis of closed-loop operation in cerebral hemodynamics."	
				5. residual language:    "whereby the residuals of each model prediction attain the role of “systemic disturbances” that essentially drive the closed-loop system in its spontaneous operation."
				6. OL v CL:
					"  However, the open-loop analysis may be misleading when a question is addressed that is affected by the closed-loop operation of this system (provided, of course, our working hypothesis is correct). The prediction of the internal (in-the-loop) variables for an externally imposed change in arterial pressure, blood flow or CO2 tension is significantly affected under the closed-loop arrangement, since the latter has effects that are “recycled” through the closed-loop system. For example, an imposed pulse change in the unobserved pressure disturbance signal, P d(t), of Fig. 2 may transform to a different waveform by the time it “shows up” as a change in the measured arterial pressure signal, P(t), that is the input to the forward model A"
					"   We take the view that the effect of external or “imposed” changes must be studied in the context of closed-loop modeling to retain a realistic understanding of physiological states (e.g., for simulating the effect of a pulse change in arterial pressure or CO2 tension upon the cerebral flow velocity"
					"   The closed-loop effects are also likely to affect the assessment of the impact of possible hemodynamic alterations caused by pathologies, clinical conditions or the administration of drugs. "}
